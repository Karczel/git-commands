## The Ultimate Guide to Using Git  (change the title)


1. Check status of the repo:
    ```
    git status
    ```
   
2. Switch branches
    ```
    git checkout branchname
    ```
3. See what has changed in your working copy:
    ```
    git diff
    ```
   or, to see just one file:
    ```
    git diff -- filename
    ```
